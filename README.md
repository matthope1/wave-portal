# Hardhat Project: My Wave Portal

This project demonstrates a basic web3 application where users can interact with the ethereum blockchain via this website: https://waveportal.matthope1.repl.co/.

(rinkeby testnet)

Users can call the Wave function on the front end by submitting a message. Their message will be stored on chain
and the smart contract contains a pseudorandom lottery. There's a 50% chance that sending a message will return some eth to the caller of the wave function.
Try it out!
